by jamil linzag

i would update  this time to time,  once i encounter a specific git issue....

to use git make sure you have git downloaded in your device
to check if you have git in your device:	
1. open your cmd:
enter: git

if (it output a bunch of commands){
then you git installed in your device
} else{
then you dony have git installed in your device
}

reminder: 
1. Git and Github are different. Git is a terminal command and Github is a website
2. upon downloading Git.. you'll get a package of git bash. it work similarly with cmd but with colors
3. you can use cmd or gitbash when inputting your code.
4. its a good habit to push your code to git when its working properly.
