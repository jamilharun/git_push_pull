when using git hub repository with git bash

you need to remember this few steps
cloning a git repository:
- git clone (link of the git repository)

editing or changing a downloaded code.
first you check code status (if things are in track)
- git status
// it will show you all the files that has been changed
// if you wanna setup those files to be saved in github...
- git add . 			//add a dot (.) if you wanna select all of those files
- git add -all 			//works the same with dot
- git add (name of the file)	//if you wanna send a specific file
git commit -m "first commit"	//you can chenge the "first commit" anything.
git branch -m main		//this branching system are for version control ii havent triied this
				//version control so i still have to study about it
git push -u origin main		//push is the call sign to "push" code into github repository
