when using git hub repository with git bash

you need to remember this few steps
cloning a git repository:
- git clone (link of the git repository)

editing or changing a downloaded code.
first you check code status (if things are in track)
- git status			// it will show you all the files that has been changed
				// if you wanna setup those files to be saved in github...
- git add . 			//add a dot (.) if you wanna select all of those files
- git add -all 			//works the same with dot
- git add (name of the file)	//if you wanna send a specific file
git commit -m "first commit"	//you can chenge the "first commit" anything.
git branch -m main		//this branching system are for version control ii havent triied this
				//version control so i still have to study about it
git push -u origin main		//push is the call sign to "push" code into github repository


To put a local folder into a Git repository, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the local folder 
you want to add to the repository.

2. Initialize the folder as a Git repository by running the following command:
- git init			//Add the files in the folder to the repository's 
				//staging area by running:
- git add .			//Commit the files to the repository by running:
- git commit -m "Initial commit"//If you want to push the repository to a remote 
				//server (e.g., GitHub), you'll need to add a remote reference and then push 							//the repository to that remote. You can do this by running the following commands:
- git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
- git push -u origin master	//That's the basic process for adding a local folder to a 
				//Git repository. If you have any questions or run into any 									//issues, don't hesitate to ask for help.
