a scenario were you mistakenly push your code to your 
git repo along with your sensitive data like..

API keys, secrets, domains, IDs

to remove a file like this in your git repo using
your local terminal

git rm -r --cached .env

if you have more than 1 data saved in your git commits.
then use this code..

git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" HEAD

make sure to commit and push the changes you put in your git repo

to completely avoid all future mistakes in push-ing sensitive data. 

go to the gitignore and add
.env
